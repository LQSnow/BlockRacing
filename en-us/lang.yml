# Scoreboard
# In slot settings, If there are no characters in the quotation marks, the line will not be displayed. If there is only one space in the quotation marks, it means that this line is empty.
# Notice! The total number of characters in each line finally displayed on the scoreboard cannot exceed 30, which is the maximum display range of a line!
# This display range includes color codes and spaces, and the text replaced by placeholders is also included!
# Text beyond the range will not be displayed!
